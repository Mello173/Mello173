- Hi, I am Marshel Jackson.
- I am a mechanic who works on German cars, currently located in Southern Utah.
- I have been learning to code because I am interested in becoming a software engineer.
- I had no experience when I started. I have so far learned the basics of Javascript & HTML & CSS, SQL, and Python. Currently I am learning Go (Golang).
- If you are interested in reaching me for some reason, you can send me an email at marsheljackson173@gmail.com
